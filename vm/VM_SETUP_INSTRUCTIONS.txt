CORE Linux - Industrial Edition
VM Setup Instructions
======================

After running setup-host.sh, you need to:

1. Create a new VM in UTM or Parallels:
   - Type: Linux
   - Architecture: ARM64
   - Memory: At least 8GB (16GB recommended)
   - Disk: At least 50GB
   - Use the downloaded Ubuntu cloud image

2. Start the VM and login

3. Copy vm-bootstrap.sh into the VM:
   - Use shared folders, or
   - SCP, or
   - Copy-paste the script content

4. Run inside VM:
   chmod +x vm-bootstrap.sh
   sudo ./vm-bootstrap.sh

5. After bootstrap completes, copy build-core.sh into VM

6. Run the build:
   chmod +x build-core.sh
   sudo ./build-core.sh

The ISO will be generated in the build directory.
